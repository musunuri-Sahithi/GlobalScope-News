# GlobalScope-News
Built a responsive web application that fetches and displays real-time news articles using the News API. Implemented category-wise filtering (e.g., technology, sports, business), search functionality, and a clean UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Handled JSON responses and dynamically updated the DOM and live news feed from external API.
